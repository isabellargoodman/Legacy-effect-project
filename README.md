# Step-1 
run main analyses  

analysis question 1.Rmd: This markdown file includes analysis and the bootstraping loop for answering question 1: whether or not previous-year NPP is still relevent in the model after inluding current-year PPT. ALso inlcudes code for supporitng figure 2.

analysis question 2&3.Rmd: This markdown file includes analysis and the bootstrapping loop for the interaction between previous-year NPP and mean annual precpitation. Also includes code for figures 2a, 4, and 5. 

analysis S1.Rmd: This markdown file includes analysis and the bootstrapping loop for supporting information analysis S1 and for creating and exporting supporting figure 1.

cold desert analysis: This markdown file includes analysis for for supporting information analysis S2. 

functions.Rmd: This markdown file includes all functions used in the previous loops 


# Step-2
create figures  

ecoregions map.Rmd: This markdown file includes code to create figure 1b. 

climate extreme analysis.Rmd: This markdown file includes code for analysis of legacy effects following climatically extreme years, and code to create figure 3.

figures for legacy paper.Rmd: This markdown file inlcudes code for creating figure 2, and supporting figure 5.
