# Step-1 
secondary question 1.Rmd: This script includes analysis and the bootstrapping loop for answering question 1: whether previous-year NPP or previous-year PPT is a stronger predictor of current year NPP. Exports all model coefficients, R-squared values and AIC values to tables, and provides code for creating and exporting supporting figure 1.

secondary question 2.Rmd: This script includes analysis and the bootstraping loop for answering question 1: whether or not previous-year NPP is still relevent in the model after inluding current-year PPT. ALso inlcudes code for supporitng figure 2.

secondary question 3.Rmd: This script includes analysis and the bootstrapping loop for the interaction between previous-year NPP and mean annual precpitation.
